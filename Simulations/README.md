## Simulations üñ•Ô∏è

Two things are required to run a simulation: 
1. A sequence
2. Some type of environmental condition

## Potential different environments we'll be doing 
1. Salt - 0.05M, 0.15M, and 0.5M NaCl 
2. Temperture - 298K and 315k 
3. pH - acidic 
4. Sugar - trehalose ([and likely more!](https://github.com/marrink-lab/martini-forcefields/blob/main/martini_forcefields/regular/v3.0.0/gmx_files/martini_v3.0.0_sugars_v2.itp))


## Submitting a simulation 
Each different condition that you will be simulating has a top level directory that describes the condition (ie - you can see `salt`, and then a sub-directory called `salt/NaCl/` because there is the potential that there are other salts that will someday be interesting.)

To run a simulation, all you need to do is run the command: `./BatchSubmit.sh`.  This will:
1. Create a bunch of subdirectories for each repition and sequence (`salt/NaCl/NaCl_{concentration}/trial#/{sequence}`)
2. Copy all necessary files to the correct folder
3. Submit the job to the slurm manager using `MS_multEquil.slurm`

## Checking on simulation status 

Running the command: 

`squeue -u {NetID}`

will return a list of all the jobs that are currently running. This isn't very helpful because it only states the name of the .slurm file, which will always be the same.  

Running the command: 

will give you the full path of the `MS_multEquil.slurm` submission, so you can check what is running. 

A good way to tell when your jobs should be done is: 
`tail -n 10 */*/run_prod.out`

This prints out the last 10 lines of a file, and GROMACS prints the estimated completion time at the end of the .out files.
